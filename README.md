# Rising Star 2018

## Description
The following is the project I was working on for the Grads in Games Rising Star
2018 competition. Entrants were tasked with taking a base prototype project from
start to completion over the course of a few months. Now that the competition is
over, I feel the need to let other people see how I went about this task.

While this this project wasn't enough to make me a finalist, I did have a lot of
fun making it, and hopefully someone else can learn something, or perhaps
attempt to recreate the conditions of the test and do better than I did.

## Credits
While I wrote most of the code, I have to give a shout-out to
[Brian Cox](http://www.briancox.be) (not that one) and Dan Dudley, who worked on
the project prototype that made the basis for the competition, as well as
[Kenney](https://kenney.nl/) who's art assets are included under a Creative
